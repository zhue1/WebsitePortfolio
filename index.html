            <p>
                Hello! My name is Eric and my interest is coding. 
                I've always loved to code ever since middle school. 
                It all started when I played Roblox and got really interested in how the game is actually made. 
                I started to snowball from there and eventually get into competitive coding and game developing.
                I am currently learning C++, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am currently making this website as my 
                portfolio for college/university. 
            </p>
